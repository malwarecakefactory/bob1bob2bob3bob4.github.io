Malware analysis and reverse engineering blog. I dissect malware samples, document obfuscation techniques, and share tools and methodologies.

## Focus Areas

- **Malware reverse engineering** - static and dynamic analysis of real-world samples
- **Obfuscation & anti-analysis** - control flow flattening, API hashing, packing
- **Tooling** - IDA Pro scripts, deobfuscation tools, automation
